Hello,
This is my project, which utilizes the CoinMarketCap API to retrieve and display data about the top 50 cryptocurrencies in the market. It features live tracking of said data and updates accordingly on a specific frequency. Currently, the logic for updating the data involves running the program and updating the CSV file at specific intervals, but this can be replaced with different triggering mechanisms.
NOTE: This project aims to store and update the data in an Excel worksheet, but since I do not have access to MS Excel, I used the CSV format instead.
